**corona\_virus.py**  
Our main script with finely tuned hyperparameters that optimize the accuracy of all future CoronaVirus regional predictions.

**novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset**
Directory filled with CSV styled data which was used to train and tune the hyperparameters of "corona\_virus.py"

All personal user space tests were ran and confirmed to work on the CloudLab profile ConTools/n-Ubuntu: https://www.cloudlab.us/p/5dcc9f6c-3f8a-11e9-910b-e4434b2381fc.
